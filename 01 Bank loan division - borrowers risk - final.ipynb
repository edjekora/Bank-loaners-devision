    "\n",
    "1. Data types: floats have to be converted to ints, losing fractions won't affect quality of data, but the data would be cleaner and processed faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Amount of values seems to match in almost all columns. There are missing values only in \"days_employed\" and \"total_income\". Because there are similar amount of values in both of those columns, I can assume that they are also in matching rows: people don't work, so they don't have an income. I would check this assumption later.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some of \"days employed\" appear as negative. The value in 4-th row also seems problematic - 340266 days convert to more than 900 years. It seems I would have not only to convert this column, but also to check all of the values. If there are too many strange values and I won't find any reasonable explanation, I won't be able to use this data. But there also seems to be no need to use it anyway, it has nothing to do with the inital task.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I see capitalized and lowercase values with the same text. They will be dealt with while looking for duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Loan purposes appear as regular uncategorized text, I will have to process it to extract the keywords, like \"purchase\", \"house\", \"car\", \"wedding\" and so on."
